# CIS-427-PA1

To run this program you must open the command line terminal and execute the server file and then the client file. The program is not finished and only the communication between both servers is working; unfortunately, we could not finish any of the commands but we did make some progress on the buy command as seen in the source code of server.py. The members in this group are Ammar Hussain (me), Ibrahim Ammar, and Ayush Das. We all contributed in various parts of the source code for both of the files. 

If run on visual studios, the server and the client should be able to commmunicate. This program was hard to implement for us but given more time we may have been able to figure it out.
